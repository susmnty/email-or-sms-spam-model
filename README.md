# email-or-sms-spam-model

This project is a simple and effective Spam Detection System built using Machine Learning techniques. It classifies incoming messages (SMS or email) as either Spam or Ham (Not Spam) based on their content. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of sample messages using TF-IDF Vectorization and a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.
